## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack React-based Food ordering App . This application was created using React components and helper functions to display a list of restaurants in the entered zipcode. The App is authenticated using firebase. In turn, each restaurant can be selected to view a list of menu items and they can be added to the cart to find the total of all the selected items and an order can be placed.
